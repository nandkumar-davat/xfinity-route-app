# Centralized Axios Configuration Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Created `utils/axiosConfig.ts`
- Exports a pre-configured `axiosInstance` with all recommended settings from the debugging guide:
  - **Timeout**: 10 seconds
  - **Headers**: Content-Type, Accept, User-Agent
  - **ValidateStatus**: Accepts 200-499 status codes
  - **HTTPS Agent**: Configured for self-signed certificates (Node.js only)
  - **Interceptors**: Request and response logging when debug mode is enabled
  - **Enhanced error handling**: Adds additional error properties (isServerError, isClientError, isAuthError, isNetworkError, isTimeout)

### 2. Refactored Services
Updated the following services to use the shared axios instance:

#### Direct axios imports replaced:
- **RouterConnectionService**: All axios calls now use `axiosInstance`
- **LiveRouterService**: All axios calls now use `axiosInstance`
- **ConnectionDiagnostics**: All axios calls now use `axiosInstance`

#### Services using authService.getAxiosInstance():
These services were already using a centralized approach through the authentication service:
- **WifiService**
- **NetworkService**
- **FirewallService**
- **DiagnosticsService**

#### Enhanced AuthenticationService:
- Now uses `createAxiosInstance()` to create its own configured instance
- Maintains backward compatibility by providing `getAxiosInstance()` method

## Benefits
1. **Consistent configuration** across all HTTP requests
2. **Centralized logging** for debugging
3. **Better error handling** with enhanced error properties
4. **Easier maintenance** - configuration changes only need to be made in one place
5. **Improved debugging** with request/response interceptors

## Usage
Any new service or component that needs to make HTTP requests should import and use the shared instance:

```typescript
import { axiosInstance } from '../utils/axiosConfig';

// Use it like regular axios
const response = await axiosInstance.get('/api/endpoint');
```
