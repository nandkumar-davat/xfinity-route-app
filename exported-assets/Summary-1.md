Summary

I have successfully completed Step 5 of strengthening Authentication & Session Management with the following implementations:

1. Moved cookie extraction/storage logic to helper functions
•  Created utils/cookieHelpers.ts with dedicated functions for cookie management
•  Functions include: extractCookiesFromResponse(), parseCookieString(), extractSessionId(), updateAxiosInstanceCookie(), and handleSessionCookie()
•  Replaced manual cookie extraction in EnhancedAuthenticationService with these helper functions

2. Ensured axiosInstance.defaults.headers.Cookie is refreshed
•  Updated login method to use handleSessionCookie() which automatically updates the axios instance
•  Added cookie handling to the global axios response interceptor in axiosConfig.ts
•  Updated initializeSession() to set cookies when restoring sessions
•  Updated clearSession() to remove cookies from axios instance
•  Modified getAxiosInstance() to ensure cookies are always current

3. Added automatic re-login functionality
•  Enhanced verifySession() to attempt auto-login when:
◦  No session exists and Config.app.saveCredentials is true
◦  Session verification fails and credentials are saved
◦  Any error occurs during verification
•  Updated refreshSession() to attempt re-login when session has expired
•  Created new tryAutoLogin() private method for handling automatic re-authentication

The implementation provides a robust session management system with automatic cookie handling and seamless re-authentication when credentials are saved. All changes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving the user experience.
I'll help you implement the discoverEndpoints function in ConnectionDiagnostics.ts. Let me first examine the current state of the file to understand its structure.
